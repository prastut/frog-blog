&lt;p&gt;FROG’s editor aims to enable a teacher or researcher to configure a complex learning flow, including multiple activities, on multiple social planes, with social groupings and data flow. The orchestration view acts as the “driver’s seat” during the class, offering controls and data visualizations to enable the teacher to be aware of what is going on with multiple students working alone and in groups with multiple activities. These are all complex information representation and user interface challenges, and there is much room for improvement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are currently engaged in a process of redesigning our interface&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Goal&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make FROG more user friendly, specifically for teachers.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
